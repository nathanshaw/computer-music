RealTime 1.25 Update Notes

Copy protection was removed from Realtime. Please disregard any mention 
of Key disk or Install in the manual. You can now make a backup copy of 
the program FOR YOUR OWN USE! You can also simply drag all the files
from the floppy to your hard disk, and execute the program from your 
hard disk, you will not be prompted to insert a key disk. 
  
New for 1.2

******  Unlimited Tracks

The number of tracks available is only limited by the amount of memory in
your ST.

******  Export Song As MIDI File
        Export Sect As MIDI File (both in the file menu)

Choosing this command makes an immediate MIDI file of a song or section 
(with fills and all variation intact) and allows you to save it to disk. 
This bypasses the need to capture and export a movie.

******  Support for MIDI file types

MIDI file types 0 and 1 are supported
                
******  Out A B C D (in the MIDI device menu)

Allows you to choose between multiple midi outs.  Out A corresponds to
the Atari's direct MIDI out. Outs B, C and D send MIDI to the three outputs
of the C-LAB export or are merged into one output (16 channels) if connected
to Dr. T's Phantom.

****** The memory indicator (located to the right of the menu)

Shows the current free memory available to RealTime.

****** 1024K.RTM

Creating a file named XXXK.RTM will cause RealTime to leave 
XXX kilobytes free for the system to use in running other programs.

****** Smart Edit memories

While in smart edit dialog :
        backspace recalls last edit
        Shift F1 - F5 stores current edit settings
        F1-F5 recalls stored edit settings

****** Independently movable tracks

Tracks can be moved by independently in the track name column

****** Miscellaneous

RealTime now remembers the position of windows and draws them faster.  Users
of previous versions of RealTime will probably notice an overall improvement
of speed and amount of available memory.


Oh and before I forget let's look at what whas added in version 1.1: 
  
1. When "Quant Durations" (in the Options Menu) is checked, the durations 
of incoming notes are quantized to the Record Quantize numerical value. 
  
2. There is a new transformation type in the Smart Edit dialog.  In the 
transformation type menus you will see "Invert about".  This option 
gives you the ability to invert notes about a pitch, invert controls 
(about 64 works best), pitchbend (try about 0) and so on. 
  
3. To time reverse a region select "Reverse Region" from the Edit menu. 
This is handy for doing retrogrades or making fade ins into fade outs 
etc...
